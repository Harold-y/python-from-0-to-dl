# Python From 0 to Deep Learning

If you want to learn, start with Basics and move forward towards Deep Learning Basics and then Convolutional Neural Networks. I will not include Numpy or Pandas Tutorial in this repo, feel free to reach out if you want these.

## Catalog
Basics: Learn basic data types, logics, functions, error handlings, etc.

DL Basics: Learn basic ideas behind ML/DL which includes gradient descent, loss function, etc.

DL CNN: Learn convolutional neural networks

Spider: a demo for python spider using beautiful-soup etc., in case you are interested.

## What's next
Highly recommend Andrew Ng's DL courses (found at deeplearning.ai). They are awesome. You will learn many powerful and popular algorithms used in DL (e.g., YOLO).
